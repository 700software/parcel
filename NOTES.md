- (upstream) modified `Config#isSource` not to check for a `source` field as a prerequisite for being source. This should probably be upstreamed.
- (bug) removed an invariant in JSPackager asserting that referenced assets cannot belong to the current bundle. This seems to be a bug where the referenced asset has a contains edge but is not reachable via traversal. It should not have a contains edge.
- allow url dependencies to be resolved from `node_modules` as a fallback if the relative path doesn't exist. This should be resolved upstream when an implementation of https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/3492 lands.
- removeAssetGraphFromBundle: should this throw?
- should bundle objects be referentially equal?
- removed entry assets from async bundles
- while traversing for building shared bundles, check if asset is missing in every bundle, and if so, stop
- rewrote creating bundle => bundle group edges to take place after optimization because this broke situations where a shared bundle had an async import.
- commented out assertion in BundlerRunner to suppress 'Bundles must have unique filePaths' error
- (upstream) rewrote getBundleGroupsReferencedByBundle in BundleGraph.js to filter for dependency nodes instead of just finding the first one
