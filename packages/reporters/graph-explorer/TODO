- Node content inside visualization is truncated. Make it clear that it is.
- Show more information on hover
- Explore other colors for nodes
- Arrowheads don't match arrow path color
- Derive node and edge types from data (instead of hardcoding). Account for the RequestGraph as well
- Search for a module and show e.g. dependencies that have react for instance
- Be able to focus nodes based on filepath or name
- Info about the bundles an asset belongs to
- Show dependency types and bundle behavior (filter for certain priorities etc.)

Aspirational

- Use shortIds in SearchView
- ^ related: Collapsed view, show the node type until you click to reveal other connections
- what do we do for a huge graph? -> should we A. just display the root and add "expand level" functionality" , B. only display one node type C. Figure out how many nodes we can reasonably render and have a cap there (i.e. tell the user they'll need to alter their filters to show different nodes)
- Diff view for comparing graphs
- Simplified view with flattened dependency nodes (represented by edges)
