- Show focused state visually in graph
- Node content inside visualization is truncated. Make it clear that it is.
- Show more information on hover
- Explore other colors for nodes
- Arrowheads don't match arrow path color

Aspirational

- Focus nodeId: should show only that node and it's immediate connections (can we focus multiple nodes)
- Focus node types: only show bundles, assets, or deps (or other)
- ^ related: Collapsed view, show the node type until you click to reveal other connections
- Be able to focus nodes based on filepath or name
- what do we do for a huge graph? -> should we A. just display the root and add "expand level" functionality" , B. only display one node type C. Figure out how many nodes we can reasonably render and have a cap there (i.e. tell the user they'll need to alter their filters to show different nodes)
