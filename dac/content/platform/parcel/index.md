# Introduction

package: `@atlassian/parcel` / [repo](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/parcel) / [public repo](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/)

Parcel is a packager for the modern web with a focus on performance and modularity. It is developed with Atlassian’s needs and scale at its core, while benefitting from contributions and resources of a healthy open source project.

Because of Atlassian's need for scale with Bitbucket and Jira, Atlassian distributes a fork with custom plugins and additional internal needs.

Please see the [Code of Conduct](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/parcel/src/bitbucket-integration/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing Guide](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/parcel/src/bitbucket-integration/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributions.

### Notable differences

- _TODO_

## Goals

- Deliver significant runtime performance improvements for Atlassian customers and build-time performance improvements for Atlassian engineers across all of our products.
- Be “The Atlassian packager”. Provide a common service that encodes performance best practices and makes them available to all of our products with little burden on product engineers.
