# Introduction

Parcel is a packager for the modern web with a focus on performance and modularity. It is developed with Atlassian’s needs and scale at its core, while benefitting from contributions and resources of a healthy open source project.

## Goals

- Deliver significant runtime performance improvements for Atlassian customers and build-time performance improvements for Atlassian engineers across all of our products.
- Be “The Atlassian packager”. Provide a common service that encodes performance best practices and makes them available to all of our products with little burden on product engineers.
